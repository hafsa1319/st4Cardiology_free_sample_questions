                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-4">●	Get the patient's consent to share her personal information with her daughter (provided that the patient has capacity).
<br>●	Listen to the daughter actively and explore her concerns.
<br>●	Explain what atrial fibrillation is. Explain that many patients with AF may not experience any symptoms, but they can still have a significant risk of having a blood clot, which can cause stroke. The need for a blood thinner is based on clinical assessment and making a balance between its benefits and the risks of bleeding (CHADS2VASc and HASBLED scores).
<br>
<br>The daughter interrupts you and asks, should warfarin be stopped at this stage?
<br>The decision to continue or stop a blood thinner is not straightforward and requires the consideration of several aspects. The patient presented with a mechanical fall; did she have previous falls? is she a recurrent faller?
<br>Moreover, an INR of 10 should raise the suspicion of cognitive impairment – the patient might be forgetful and taking lots of warfarin tablets daily.
<br>On the other hand, having extensive bruises should raise safeguarding concerns, especially since she is at an extreme age and can be vulnerable.
<br>These factors affect the risk and benefit profile of anticoagulation. Stopping warfarin will reduce bleeding risk but will put the patient at risk of stroke. On the contrary, continuing warfarin will make stroke chances significantly less, but the patient will be at a higher risk of bleeding and having more. There is the option of switching warfarin to NOAC, however, the latter is also not free of bleeding risk. It is essential in this case to remain broad-minded and to be aware that there are no black and white options as each has its pros and cons and the decision will require further assessment and senior advice.&nbsp;<br></p>
